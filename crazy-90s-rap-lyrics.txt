I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
Tryin' to play me out like as if my name was Sega
I jack off inside books and bring life to words, leaving concepts stuck together that you've never heard
Put a quarter in your ass cuz you played yourself
I've ran through every bitch in my path, I was fucking chicks in the ass when I was six and a half
Got so many chains, they call me Chaining Tatum
